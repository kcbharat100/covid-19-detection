# covid-19-detection

The detection of covid-19 is based on X-rays using convolutional neural network.
Covid-19 X-rays have been taken from:
https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset

Normal X-rays have been taken from:
https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

Altogether there are 125 X-rays both for covid-19 and normal case.
Also, there are seperate 8 different testing X-rays for each case.

I'm working on this and will release code as soon as I get better accuracy.
