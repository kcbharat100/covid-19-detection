# covid-19-detection

The detection of covid-19 is based on X-rays using convolutional neural network.
Covid-19 X-rays have been taken from:
Joseph Paul Cohen and Paul Morrison and Lan Dao
COVID-19 image data collection, arXiv:2003.11597, 2020
https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset

Normal X-rays have been taken from:

No_Findings and Pneumonia X-rays have been taken from:
Automated detection of COVID-19 cases using deep neural networks with X-ray images

Directory dataset_binary contains 500 "normal" and 206 "covid" xrays.

Directory dataset_multi_class contains 500 "no_findings", 500 "pneumonia" and 206 "covid" xrays.

I'm working on this and will release code as soon as I get better accuracy.
