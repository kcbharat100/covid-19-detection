# covid-19-detection

The detection of covid-19 is based on X-rays using convolutional neural network.
Covid-19 X-rays have been taken from:
https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset

Normal X-rays have been taken from:
https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

In dataset1: (normal vs covid)
121 imagaes for training
21 images for test

I'm working on this and will release code as soon as I get better accuracy.
